# Written-technical-papers

This Github repository consists of some technical papers I have written regarding the projects I have done. Feel free to read through them to find more details of a certain project (or just out of curiosity of course!).

- **Albert_retail_store_stocking**: This is a paper about a robot arm on a mobile base that uses knowledge engineering and symbolic reasoning to stock shelves in a super market.

- **Deep Learning End-to-End Strategies for Object Affordance in Robotic Manipulation**: This is a paper about a thorough literature review of different techniques for robots to learn affordance in combination with manipulation tasks.

- **Designing a Haptic Force Feedback Glove with Active and Passive Force Feedback Elements**: This is a paper about the design process of a haptic glove that has both active and passive force feedback by interacting with objects in AR or VR.

- **GUIDO**: This is a paper about the design of a robotic guidance dog system. This is explained with 3 design options where haptic force feedback can be given through a remote cane and a robotic guidance robot that scans the perimeter around the user.

- **LLM-Enhanced _Robotic_Affordance_and_Control_System_in_Robotic_Manipulation**: This is a paper about my thesis research where I propose a system called LERACS that uses LLMs and robotic integrated vision algorithms to explain a scene and make a query of actions to perform on the basis of certain user instructions.
